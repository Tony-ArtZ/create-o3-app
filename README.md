## 🚀 Get started

```bash
npx create-o3-app@latest
# or
pnpm dlx create-o3-app@latest
# or
yarn create o3-app
# or
bunx create-o3-app@latest
```

**That's it.** Follow the prompts and you'll have a bleeding-edge, type-safe, full-stack app in seconds.

---

## What is this?

The **O3 Stack** is T3's unhinged sibling. We took everything great about T3 and cranked it up to 11. Where T3 carefully selects proven technologies, we grab the coolest, newest, most exciting tools and smash them together into something beautiful.

**The Stack:**

- 🔥 **[oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com/)** - Because tRPC is so 2023
- 🛡️ **[BetterAuth](https://better-auth.com/)** or **[Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)** - Your auth, your rules
- 🗄️ **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** - SQL that doesn't hate you
- ✅ **[ArkType](https://arktype.io/)** - Runtime validation that's actually fast
- ⚡ **[Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)** - Because we live on the bleeding edge
- 🗄️ **[NeonDB](https://neon.com/)** - Who has time to setup a Database ?

---

## Why O3?

**We love new shit.** That dopamine hit from trying cutting-edge tech? We're addicted. We don't wait for things to be "stable" or "production-ready" – we dive headfirst into the newest, most experimental tools and figure it out as we go.

**Type safety is non-negotiable.** From your database to your UI, every single piece talks to every other piece with perfect TypeScript inference. No `any` types. No runtime surprises. Just pure, beautiful type safety.

**Modularity by design.** Don't want auth? Skip it. Don't need a database? No problem. Every piece is optional, and the CLI generates exactly what you need.

## The O3 Philosophy

1. **Newer is better** - We don't wait for "production-ready"
2. **Types everywhere** - If it's not type-safe, it doesn't belong
3. **Developer happiness** - Tools should spark joy, not frustration
4. **Modular by default** - Use what you need, skip what you don't
5. **Community-driven** - The best ideas come from developers building real stuff
